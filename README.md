* _**3.0+:**_ Godot Engine 3.3+

## Setup

### Adding to a existing project

(Any kind of high-level multiplayer peer is required.)
1. Click on the AssetLib inside editor or go to the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/425) to download the latest release, or you can clone/download this repository to get the latest commit.
2. Select the `addons/godot-voip` folder and move it into your Godot project. 
(**Note**: make sure the structure is still `res://addons/godot-voip`)
3. Go to project-settings/audio and enable audio input.
4. Now go to the plugins tab also inside project-settings and enable the godot-voip plugin.
5. Add either a `VoiceInstance` (one connection) or a `VoiceOrchestrator` (more than 2 participants) node to your scene.
6. Set `$VoiceInstance.recording` or `$VoiceOrchestrator.recording` to `true` and it will send your microphone input to connected participants.

### Running demo
1. Go to the templates tab in the Godot Engine project manager and look for godot-voip, or go to the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/951) to manually download the latest release, or you can clone/download this repository to get the latest commit.
2. Open downloaded project.

### For macOS users
Users running godot-voip on macOS need to make sure the microphone format in macOS audio settings is equal to the mix-rate in Godot project-settings.
